Using clb-py-tools
========================================

The clb-py-tools package provides utilities to interact with the `EBrains <https://ebrains.eu/>`_ `Collaboratory <https://wiki.ebrains.eu/bin/view/Main/>`_ 2.0 environment.

There are libraries to interact with the Identity and Access Management (IAM) server for authentication, for dealing with authorisation using the identity info from the IAM server, and for interacting with the wiki.
